# 2-D Notebooks

## LoadingResnetModelTest.ipynb
This notebook loads the saved ResNet50 model (get from Google Drive), and runs the test sequence to show the
results of the model.

## TeamProjectResnetModelTrain.ipynb
This notebook trains and saves a ResNet model. You can see example training and validation accuracy of the trained
model.

## TeamProjectExtractImages.ipynb
This notebook utilizes MICrONS tools to extract a dataset of 2D images of excitatory and inhibitory matrix.
The train, val, and test set all have their unique neurons and synapses to avoid data leakage.

## TeamProjectCNNModelTrain.ipynb
This notebook trains and saves a custom CNN model. You can see example training and validation accuracy of the trained
model.
